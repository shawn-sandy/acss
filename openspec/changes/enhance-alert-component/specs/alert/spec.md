# Alert Component Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Alert Display
The Alert component SHALL render status messages with configurable severity levels (default, info, success, warning, error) and provide visual differentiation through colors and icons.

#### Scenario: Basic alert rendering
- **WHEN** Alert is rendered with `open={true}` and message content
- **THEN** the component displays with role="alert" and appropriate ARIA attributes
- **AND** the message content is visible to users

#### Scenario: Severity visual indicators
- **WHEN** Alert severity is set to "info", "success", "warning", or "error"
- **THEN** the component applies corresponding background color, border color, and text color
- **AND** displays the appropriate severity icon

#### Scenario: Hidden state
- **WHEN** Alert is rendered with `open={false}`
- **THEN** the component returns null and is not rendered in the DOM

### Requirement: Dismissible Alerts
The Alert component SHALL support user-initiated dismissal when the `dismissible` prop is true.

#### Scenario: Dismiss button display
- **WHEN** Alert has `dismissible={true}`
- **THEN** a dismiss button is rendered with appropriate ARIA labels
- **AND** the button is keyboard accessible

#### Scenario: Dismiss interaction
- **WHEN** user clicks the dismiss button
- **THEN** the `onDismiss` callback is invoked
- **AND** the alert's visibility state changes to false

### Requirement: Alert Accessibility
The Alert component SHALL implement proper accessibility features for screen readers and keyboard users.

#### Scenario: ARIA live region
- **WHEN** Alert has severity "error"
- **THEN** aria-live attribute is set to "assertive"
- **WHEN** Alert has severity "info", "success", "warning", or "default"
- **THEN** aria-live attribute is set to "polite"

#### Scenario: Atomic updates
- **WHEN** Alert content changes
- **THEN** aria-atomic="true" ensures screen readers announce the entire alert content

### Requirement: Alert Customization
The Alert component SHALL support visual and content customization through props and CSS custom properties.

#### Scenario: Icon customization
- **WHEN** Alert receives `iconProps` with custom size or attributes
- **THEN** the icon is rendered with merged default and custom properties
- **WHEN** Alert has `hideIcon={true}`
- **THEN** no icon is displayed

#### Scenario: Optional title
- **WHEN** Alert includes a `title` prop
- **THEN** the title is rendered as an h3 element within the alert message area

#### Scenario: CSS theming
- **WHEN** CSS custom properties are defined (e.g., --alert-bg, --alert-border)
- **THEN** the component uses these values for styling
- **AND** falls back to default values when custom properties are not defined

### Requirement: Exit Animations
The Alert component SHALL provide smooth visual transitions when dismissing alerts.

#### Scenario: Fade-out animation
- **WHEN** user dismisses an alert
- **THEN** the component applies opacity and transform transitions over 300ms
- **AND** the alert fades out and slides up before being removed from DOM
- **AND** the `onDismiss` callback is invoked after the animation completes

#### Scenario: Reduced motion preference
- **WHEN** user has `prefers-reduced-motion` media query active
- **THEN** exit animations are disabled or minimized
- **AND** the alert is removed with reduced or no transition duration

### Requirement: Auto-Dismiss Functionality
The Alert component SHALL support automatic dismissal after a configurable duration.

#### Scenario: Timed auto-dismiss
- **WHEN** Alert has `autoHideDuration` prop set (e.g., 5000ms)
- **THEN** a timer starts when the alert becomes visible
- **AND** the alert automatically dismisses after the specified duration
- **AND** the `onDismiss` callback is invoked

#### Scenario: Disabled auto-dismiss
- **WHEN** Alert has `autoHideDuration` set to 0, undefined, or not provided
- **THEN** no automatic dismissal timer is started
- **AND** the alert remains visible until manually dismissed

#### Scenario: Timer cleanup
- **WHEN** Alert is unmounted before auto-dismiss timer completes
- **THEN** the timer is properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement: Keyboard Interaction
The Alert component SHALL support keyboard-based dismissal for improved accessibility.

#### Scenario: ESC key dismissal
- **WHEN** Alert is dismissible and visible
- **AND** user presses the ESC key
- **THEN** the alert is dismissed
- **AND** the `onDismiss` callback is invoked

#### Scenario: ESC key listener lifecycle
- **WHEN** Alert becomes non-dismissible or hidden
- **THEN** the ESC key event listener is removed
- **AND** no memory leaks occur from lingering listeners

### Requirement: Performance Optimization
The Alert component SHALL optimize rendering performance through memoization.

#### Scenario: Icon memoization
- **WHEN** Alert re-renders with the same severity and icon props
- **THEN** the severity icon element is retrieved from cache
- **AND** no new icon element is created

#### Scenario: Memoization invalidation
- **WHEN** Alert severity or iconProps change
- **THEN** the icon memoization is invalidated
- **AND** a new icon element is created with updated properties

### Requirement: Action Buttons Support
The Alert component SHALL support custom action buttons for user interactions.

#### Scenario: Custom actions rendering
- **WHEN** Alert receives `actions` prop with React elements
- **THEN** the actions are rendered within the alert message area
- **AND** actions are displayed below the main message content

#### Scenario: Action buttons with dismiss
- **WHEN** Alert has both custom actions and is dismissible
- **THEN** action buttons are displayed separately from the dismiss button
- **AND** both action buttons and dismiss button are accessible

### Requirement: Focus Management
The Alert component SHALL support automatic focus for critical alerts.

#### Scenario: Auto-focus on critical alerts
- **WHEN** Alert has `autoFocus={true}` and becomes visible
- **THEN** the alert container receives focus
- **AND** screen readers are notified of the alert

#### Scenario: Focus restoration
- **WHEN** Alert with autoFocus is dismissed
- **THEN** focus returns to the previously focused element if appropriate

### Requirement: Alert Variants
The Alert component SHALL support multiple visual styles through the `variant` prop.

#### Scenario: Outlined variant
- **WHEN** Alert has `variant="outlined"` or no variant specified
- **THEN** the alert displays with a border and lighter background
- **AND** uses severity-specific border colors

#### Scenario: Filled variant
- **WHEN** Alert has `variant="filled"`
- **THEN** the alert displays with solid severity-colored background
- **AND** uses white text color for contrast

#### Scenario: Soft variant
- **WHEN** Alert has `variant="soft"`
- **THEN** the alert displays with no border
- **AND** uses subtle background colors based on severity

### Requirement: Component Testing
The Alert component SHALL have comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality.

#### Scenario: Rendering tests
- **WHEN** unit tests are executed
- **THEN** tests verify basic rendering with title and message
- **AND** tests verify all severity levels render correctly
- **AND** tests verify icon visibility based on props

#### Scenario: Interaction tests
- **WHEN** unit tests are executed
- **THEN** tests verify dismiss button click invokes callback
- **AND** tests verify ESC key dismissal works
- **AND** tests verify auto-dismiss timer functionality

#### Scenario: Accessibility tests
- **WHEN** unit tests are executed
- **THEN** tests verify correct aria-live values for each severity
- **AND** tests verify aria-atomic attribute is present
- **AND** tests verify keyboard navigation works correctly
