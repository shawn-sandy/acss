# Link Component Specification

## Purpose

The Link component provides an accessible, semantic anchor element with enhanced security for external links, flexible styling variants, and full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. It ensures proper keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and visual accessibility for all users.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Reduced Motion Support

The Link component SHALL respect user motion preferences to prevent triggering motion sensitivity or vestibular disorders.

#### Scenario: User prefers reduced motion

- **WHEN** a user has set `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` in their operating system
- **THEN** all link transitions SHALL be disabled (`--link-transition: none`)
- **AND** scale transforms on button-styled links SHALL be disabled
- **AND** the link SHALL remain fully functional without animations

#### Scenario: User has no motion preference

- **WHEN** a user has not set a reduced motion preference
- **THEN** standard transitions SHALL apply with a duration of 0.2s
- **AND** button-styled links SHALL include scale transforms on interaction

#### Scenario: CSS media query implementation

- **WHEN** the Link component SCSS is compiled
- **THEN** it SHALL include a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` media query
- **AND** the media query SHALL set `--link-transition: none`
- **AND** the media query SHALL disable transform animations

### Requirement: Required Href Attribute

The Link component SHALL require an `href` attribute to ensure keyboard accessibility and proper semantic meaning.

#### Scenario: TypeScript compile-time enforcement

- **WHEN** a developer uses the Link component in TypeScript
- **THEN** the `href` prop SHALL be marked as required (not optional)
- **AND** TypeScript SHALL produce a compile error if href is omitted
- **AND** the error message SHALL indicate that href is required for accessibility

#### Scenario: Migration from optional href

- **WHEN** existing code uses Link without href
- **THEN** TypeScript compilation SHALL fail with a clear error
- **AND** JSDoc documentation SHALL provide migration guidance
- **AND** the fix SHALL be to add a valid href attribute (e.g., "#", "/", or a valid URL)

#### Scenario: Anchor element semantics

- **WHEN** a Link component is rendered with an href
- **THEN** it SHALL render as a semantic `<a>` element
- **AND** it SHALL be keyboard focusable via Tab key
- **AND** screen readers SHALL announce it as a link

### Requirement: Icon-Only Link Validation

The Link component SHALL validate that icon-only links have accessible labels in development mode.

#### Scenario: Icon-only link with aria-label

- **WHEN** a Link contains only icon/SVG children and includes `aria-label`
- **THEN** no warning SHALL be displayed
- **AND** the link SHALL have an accessible name from `aria-label`

#### Scenario: Icon-only link without accessible label

- **WHEN** a Link contains only icon/SVG children in development mode
- **AND** it lacks both `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`
- **THEN** a console warning SHALL be displayed
- **AND** the warning SHALL state: "Link: Icon-only links should include aria-label for accessibility"
- **AND** the warning SHALL only appear when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`

#### Scenario: Link with text content

- **WHEN** a Link contains text content as children
- **THEN** no validation warning SHALL be displayed
- **AND** the text content SHALL serve as the accessible name

#### Scenario: Icon-only link with aria-labelledby

- **WHEN** a Link contains only icon/SVG children and includes `aria-labelledby`
- **THEN** no warning SHALL be displayed
- **AND** the link SHALL have an accessible name from the referenced element

### Requirement: Minimum Touch Target Size

Button-styled links SHALL meet minimum touch target size guidelines to support users with motor impairments and mobile users.

#### Scenario: Button-styled link sizing

- **WHEN** a Link uses button styling (`btnStyle` prop, `<b>` wrapper, or `<i>` wrapper)
- **THEN** it SHALL have a minimum height of 2.75rem (44px at base 16px)
- **AND** it SHALL have a minimum width of 2.75rem (44px at base 16px)
- **AND** padding SHALL ensure comfortable tap targets on mobile devices

#### Scenario: Regular text link sizing

- **WHEN** a Link is rendered as a standard text link (no button styling)
- **THEN** minimum touch target sizes MAY be smaller
- **AND** the clickable area SHALL still be easily targetable on mobile devices

#### Scenario: Small viewport interaction

- **WHEN** a button-styled Link is rendered on a mobile device
- **THEN** users SHALL be able to tap it accurately without accidentally tapping adjacent elements
- **AND** the touch target SHALL meet WCAG 2.5.5 Level AAA guidelines (44Ã—44px minimum)

### Requirement: Visited Link Color Contrast

The Link component SHALL ensure visited links have sufficient color contrast to meet WCAG 1.4.3 requirements.

#### Scenario: Visited link distinct color

- **WHEN** a user has previously visited the link destination
- **THEN** the link SHALL display with a distinct visited color
- **AND** the visited color SHALL be defined by `--link-visited-color` CSS custom property
- **AND** the default visited color SHALL be `#5a3284` (accessible purple)

#### Scenario: Visited link contrast ratio

- **WHEN** a visited link is rendered on any background
- **THEN** it SHALL maintain a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text (WCAG 1.4.3 Level AA)
- **AND** the color SHALL be visually distinguishable from unvisited links

#### Scenario: Custom visited color override

- **WHEN** a developer overrides `--link-visited-color` via the styles prop
- **THEN** the Link SHALL use the custom color for visited state
- **AND** documentation SHALL remind developers to ensure WCAG 1.4.3 compliance

### Requirement: Optimized Transition Performance

The Link component SHALL use performant transition durations to avoid perceived sluggishness.

#### Scenario: Default transition timing

- **WHEN** a Link component is rendered
- **THEN** the default transition duration SHALL be 0.2s (200ms)
- **AND** the transition timing function SHALL be `ease-in-out`
- **AND** the transition SHALL feel responsive to user interactions

#### Scenario: Migration from slow transitions

- **WHEN** upgrading from a previous version with 0.75s transitions
- **THEN** users SHALL perceive faster, more responsive interactions
- **AND** the change SHALL improve perceived performance
- **AND** no visual functionality SHALL be lost

#### Scenario: Custom transition override

- **WHEN** a developer sets a custom `--link-transition` value
- **THEN** the Link SHALL use the custom transition
- **AND** the custom value SHALL override the default 0.2s timing

### Requirement: Enhanced Hover State Feedback

The Link component SHALL provide multiple visual cues on hover beyond underline decoration to support users with color blindness.

#### Scenario: Hover state visual feedback

- **WHEN** a user hovers over a text link with a mouse
- **THEN** the link SHALL display an underline decoration
- **AND** the link SHALL reduce opacity to 0.8
- **AND** the combined visual changes SHALL be distinguishable without relying solely on color

#### Scenario: Button-styled link hover

- **WHEN** a user hovers over a button-styled link
- **THEN** the link SHALL provide visual feedback without underline
- **AND** the opacity change SHALL indicate interactivity
- **AND** the scale transform SHALL apply (unless reduced motion is enabled)

#### Scenario: Focus state distinct from hover

- **WHEN** a link receives keyboard focus
- **THEN** the focus indicator SHALL be visually distinct from hover state
- **AND** the focus outline SHALL meet WCAG 2.4.7 (3:1 contrast minimum)
- **AND** both focus and hover states MAY be active simultaneously
