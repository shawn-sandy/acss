# Alert Component Specification - CDD Refactoring

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Component Maintainability
The Alert component SHALL follow Component-Driven Development (CDD) principles with clear separation of concerns to ensure long-term maintainability and code clarity.

**Implementation Note (SIMPLIFIED APPROACH):** Uses a single `useAlertBehavior` hook to consolidate all stateful logic. Sub-components are NOT extracted to avoid premature abstraction (deferred until reuse emerges in other components).

#### Scenario: Single Responsibility Principle
- **WHEN** reviewing component code structure
- **THEN** each function (hook, pure function) has one clear, well-defined purpose
- **AND** functions are named to clearly communicate their responsibility
- **AND** no single function exceeds 80 lines of code (excluding types/comments)
- **AND** complex logic is broken down when needed (not prematurely)

#### Scenario: Hook Consolidation for Behavior (SIMPLIFIED)
- **WHEN** component manages stateful behavior
- **THEN** behavior is extracted into ONE cohesive custom hook (`useAlertBehavior`)
- **AND** the hook manages all related concerns (visibility, auto-dismiss, keyboard, focus)
- **AND** hook returns focused interface with clear inputs and outputs
- **AND** hook can be tested independently without rendering the full component
- **AND** hook behaviors can be split later if reuse emerges in other components

#### Scenario: UI Rendering (No Sub-components Yet)
- **WHEN** component renders UI elements
- **THEN** JSX remains in main component body (readable ~30 lines)
- **AND** rendering logic is straightforward and maintainable
- **AND** sub-components can be extracted later if 2+ components need them
- **AND** follows YAGNI principle (don't create abstractions prematurely)

#### Scenario: Configuration Separation
- **WHEN** component uses static mappings, constants, or configuration
- **THEN** constants are extracted to the top of the file
- **AND** constants use TypeScript const assertions for type safety
- **AND** functions accessing constants are implemented as pure functions
- **AND** configuration is easy to locate and modify

#### Scenario: Code Organization Structure (SIMPLIFIED)
- **WHEN** opening the component file
- **THEN** code follows clear organizational sections in order:
  1. Types & Configuration (severity types, ARIA mappings, pure functions)
  2. Component Props (AlertProps type definition)
  3. Custom Hook (useAlertBehavior - single consolidated hook)
  4. Main Component (Alert component using hook)
- **AND** each section is clearly delineated with comment banners
- **AND** related code is grouped together logically

### Requirement: Component Testability
The Alert component SHALL be structured to enable comprehensive unit testing of individual behaviors in isolation.

**Implementation Note (SIMPLIFIED):** Single `useAlertBehavior` hook can be tested independently. UI rendering tests use full component (no sub-components).

#### Scenario: Hook Unit Testing (SIMPLIFIED)
- **WHEN** testing component behavior
- **THEN** `useAlertBehavior` hook can be tested in isolation using @testing-library/react-hooks or renderHook
- **AND** hook tests don't require rendering the full Alert component
- **AND** hook tests verify all behaviors (visibility, auto-dismiss, keyboard, focus) together
- **AND** hook tests cover edge cases (cleanup, dependencies, re-renders, pause/resume)
- **AND** if specific behaviors need isolation later, hook can be split

#### Scenario: UI Rendering Testing (No Sub-components)
- **WHEN** testing UI rendering
- **THEN** tests render the full Alert component (JSX is maintainable in one place)
- **AND** tests verify prop handling and conditional rendering logic
- **AND** tests remain fast (Alert component is not overly complex)
- **AND** sub-components can be extracted later if testing becomes unwieldy

#### Scenario: Integration Testing (SIMPLIFIED)
- **WHEN** testing full component functionality
- **THEN** integration tests verify hook and component UI work together correctly
- **AND** integration tests cover complete user workflows
- **AND** integration tests maintain current coverage levels (no regression)
- **AND** integration tests use the component's public API only

#### Scenario: Test Isolation Benefits (SIMPLIFIED)
- **WHEN** a specific behavior has a bug
- **THEN** behavior bugs can be reproduced with focused `useAlertBehavior` hook test
- **AND** UI bugs can be reproduced with focused component rendering test
- **AND** the fix can be verified at appropriate level (hook vs component)
- **AND** test failures clearly indicate which piece is broken (behavior vs rendering)

### Requirement: Code Reusability
The Alert component SHALL extract common patterns into reusable pieces that can benefit other components in the library.

**Implementation Note (PRAGMATIC):** Follows "Rule of Three" - extract for reuse when 2+ components need it, not before. Currently extracted: configuration constants and `useAlertBehavior` hook (can be split later if specific behaviors are needed elsewhere).

#### Scenario: Hook Reusability (DEFERRED)
- **WHEN** implementing other components with similar behavior (modals, toasts, snackbars)
- **THEN** `useAlertBehavior` hook CAN be reused as-is OR specific behaviors can be extracted
- **AND** if Modal needs only auto-dismiss, extract `useAutoDismiss` from `useAlertBehavior`
- **AND** if Toast needs only visibility, extract `useVisibility` from `useAlertBehavior`
- **AND** hooks are documented with JSDoc for usage guidance
- **AND** extraction happens when second use case emerges, not speculatively

#### Scenario: Configuration Reusability (IMMEDIATE)
- **WHEN** other components need severity-based ARIA or icon mappings
- **THEN** `SEVERITY_ARIA_LIVE` and `getSeverityIcon()` can be extracted to shared constants
- **AND** configuration uses TypeScript const assertions for type safety
- **AND** pure functions work in any component context

#### Scenario: Pattern Consistency
- **WHEN** refactoring other complex components
- **THEN** CDD patterns established in Alert serve as reference implementation
- **AND** consistent approaches improve codebase-wide maintainability
- **AND** developers can learn CDD principles from Alert example

### Requirement: Backward Compatibility
The Alert component refactoring SHALL maintain complete backward compatibility with existing usage.

#### Scenario: Public API Preservation
- **WHEN** Alert component is refactored internally
- **THEN** all existing props work identically (no changes to AlertProps type)
- **AND** all prop combinations produce same visual output
- **AND** all callbacks fire at same times with same arguments
- **AND** component display name and exports remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Test Compatibility
- **WHEN** refactoring is complete
- **THEN** all existing integration tests pass without modification
- **AND** all Storybook stories render identically
- **AND** no new console warnings or errors appear
- **AND** accessibility tests continue to pass

#### Scenario: Performance Preservation
- **WHEN** comparing pre and post-refactoring performance
- **THEN** render performance is neutral or improved
- **AND** bundle size is unchanged or smaller
- **AND** no new memory leaks are introduced
- **AND** animations and transitions remain smooth

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Alert Display
The Alert component SHALL render status messages with configurable severity levels (default, info, success, warning, error) and provide visual differentiation through colors and icons.

**Implementation Note:** Component internally uses Component-Driven Development principles with extracted hooks for behavior management and sub-components for UI composition. The main Alert component serves as a composition layer orchestrating smaller, focused pieces.

#### Scenario: Basic alert rendering
- **WHEN** Alert is rendered with `open={true}` and message content
- **THEN** the component displays with role="alert" and appropriate ARIA attributes
- **AND** the message content is visible to users

#### Scenario: Severity visual indicators
- **WHEN** Alert severity is set to "info", "success", "warning", or "error"
- **THEN** the component applies corresponding background color, border color, and text color
- **AND** displays the appropriate severity icon

#### Scenario: Hidden state
- **WHEN** Alert is rendered with `open={false}`
- **THEN** the component returns null and is not rendered in the DOM

### Requirement: Performance Optimization
The Alert component SHALL optimize rendering performance through appropriate memoization and pure function usage.

**Implementation Note:** Severity icon rendering uses pure function approach (`getSeverityIcon()`) instead of `useMemo` for simplicity and clarity. Configuration constants prevent recreation of static objects on every render.

#### Scenario: Icon rendering optimization
- **WHEN** Alert re-renders with the same severity and icon props
- **THEN** icon creation uses pure function with stable configuration constants
- **AND** no unnecessary icon recreations occur

#### Scenario: Configuration stability
- **WHEN** Alert re-renders
- **THEN** static configuration objects (ARIA mappings, screen reader text) are not recreated
- **AND** configuration is referenced from stable constants at file scope
- **AND** TypeScript const assertions provide type safety

#### Scenario: Hook optimization
- **WHEN** custom hooks manage component behavior
- **THEN** hooks use appropriate memoization (useCallback) for returned functions
- **AND** hook dependencies are properly specified to prevent stale closures
- **AND** cleanup functions properly dispose of timers and event listeners
