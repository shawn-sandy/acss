# Card Component

The Card component is a versatile and reusable React component for creating
card-like UI elements. It's part of the FPKit React component library.

## Usage

```tsx
import Card from "@fpkit/cards";

<Card elm="div">
  <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
  <Card.Content
    className="custom-card-content"
    styles={{ color: "blue", padding: "1rem" }}
  >
    This is the content of the card.
  </Card.Content>
</Card>;
```

## Components

### Card

The main container component for the card.

#### Props

- `elm?: 'div' | 'aside' | 'section' | 'article'` - HTML element to render as
  (default: 'div')
- `title?: React.ReactNode` - Card title
- `footer?: React.ReactNode` - Card footer
- `styles?: React.CSSProperties` - Inline styles
- `classes?: string` - Additional CSS classes
- `id?: string` - Unique ID for the card

All other props, such as `aria-*` attributes, `data-*` attributes, and event
handlers (e.g., `onClick`, `onMouseEnter`), are passed through to the underlying
UI component. This allows you to customize the behavior and accessibility of the
Card component as needed.

### Card.Title

A sub-component for rendering the card's title.

#### Props

- `as?: React.ElementType` - HTML element to render as (default: 'h3')
- `className?: string` - Additional CSS classes
- `styles?: React.CSSProperties` - Inline styles

#### Example

### Card.Content

A sub-component for rendering the card's main content.

#### Props

- `className?: string` - Additional CSS classes
- `styles?: React.CSSProperties` - Inline styles

## Styling

The component uses CSS classes for styling:

- `.card-title` for the title
- `.card-content` for the content

To integrate these styles with CSS Modules or SASS/SCSS:

1. Create a CSS Module file (e.g., `Card.module.scss`) or a SASS/SCSS file
   (e.g., `Card.scss`).

## Accessibility

The Card component is designed with accessibility in mind:

- It uses semantic HTML elements (`div`, `aside`, `section`, or `article`) for
  the main container.
- The Title component defaults to using an `h3` element, which can be changed if
  needed.
- The Content component uses an `article` element for semantic structure.

### Example with ARIA Attributes

```tsx
<Card classes={styles.card}>
  <Card.Title className={styles.cardTitle}>Card Title</Card.Title>
  <Card.Content className={styles.cardContent}>
    This is the content of the card.
  </Card.Content>
</Card>
```

You can override these classes or provide additional styling through the
`className` and `styles` props.
