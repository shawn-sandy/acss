# Understanding copilot-instructions.md

## Overview

This file serves as a comprehensive guide for writing code in a modern React project. It acts as a standardized rulebook ensuring consistent development practices across the project.

## Purpose & Function

The file functions like a detailed instruction manual that guides developers and AI assistants on maintaining consistent code quality and structure throughout the project.

## Input Categories

The guide addresses several key development scenarios:

- React component development
- CSS styling approaches
- TypeScript implementation
- Test writing procedures
- Measurement conversions

## Output Standards

The guide produces clear standards for:

- React component structure (functional components with hooks)
- CSS styling (Tailwind implementation)
- Type safety (TypeScript guidelines)
- Testing protocols
- Measurement units (rem-based system)

## Implementation Methodology

The file organizes development standards into distinct sections:

1. **React Components**
   - Modern hooks usage
   - Functional component patterns
   - Performance optimization guidelines

2. **CSS Standards**
   - Tailwind CSS implementation
   - Unit consistency
   - Responsive design practices

3. **TypeScript Guidelines**
   - Type safety protocols
   - Data handling standards
   - Interface definitions

4. **Testing Framework**
   - Code verification procedures
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Quality assurance standards

## Key Concepts

- TypeScript implementation for error prevention
- Accessibility and responsive design principles
- Comprehensive testing protocols
- Tailwind CSS styling standards
- Code formatting consistency via ESLint and Prettier

## Analogy

Think of this file as a newspaper's style guide - just as journalists follow specific writing rules, this file helps developers maintain consistent coding standards across the project.
