# Write Conventional Commit Messages

1. **Start with a type**: Choose a type that describes the changes you are making. For example, `feat` for a new feature, `fix` for a bug fix, `docs` for documentation changes, and `style` for changes that do not affect the code.
2. **Add a scope**: If the change is specific to a part of the codebase, add a scope. For example, `docs(readme)` or `feat(login)`.
3. **Write a short description**: Write a short description in the present tense. For example, `add new feature` or `fix login bug`.
4. **Add a body**: If the description is not enough, add a body to provide more context. For example, `closes #123` or `BREAKING CHANGE: login no longer accepts username`.
5. **Add a footer**: Add a footer to reference issues or pull requests related to the commit. For example, `closes #123` or `see also #456`.    
6. **Separate the sections**: Separate the sections with a blank line.
7. **Use the imperative mood**: Write the description in the imperative mood. For example, `add new feature` instead of `added new feature`.
