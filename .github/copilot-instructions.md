## When Writing tickets for features, enhancements and bugs

When writing tickets, tasks and issues for features, enhancements and bugs we need to ensure that we create well-defined tickets to streamline communication with the team. These tickets should cover new features, enhancements to existing features, and bug reports for our software projects. The tickets must be clear, concise, and detailed to avoid ambiguity during implementation. They must be written in a way that is easy to understand and follow. They should follow the project guidelines and best practices. Always include WCAG 2.1 guidelines for accessibility related to the task. Follow the list below for additional instructions on writing tickets/tasks/issues.  

- Use a structured format with headers and bullet points for clarity.  
- Write in a professional and concise tone, avoiding unnecessary jargon.  
- Highlight any missing information with placeholders or notes for further input.  
- Ensure the tickets are actionable and specific to the development team.  
- Include a section for team comments or questions, if applicable.
- Recommend ways to improve the ticket.
- Use the `./tickets.md` file in the current directory as a reference for writing tickets.
- place all tickets in a `./tickets` folder in the `root` directory.
- Name tickets with a `*.ticket.md` extension (FeatureName.ticket.md, EnhancementName.ticket.md, BugName.ticket.md)
