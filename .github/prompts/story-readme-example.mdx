### Dialog Component

The base `Dialog` component provides core modal functionality:

- Controlled modal behavior with `isOpen` prop
- Built-in accessibility features with ARIA support
- Custom header with close button (optional)
- Event handling for open, close, and cancel actions
- Support for alert dialogs via `isAlertDialog` prop

### Props

The `Dialog` component accepts the following props:

- `dialogId?: string`: The ID of the dialog, used for ARIA attributes.
- `arialLabel?: string`: The ARIA label for the dialog.
- `isOpen?: boolean`: Controls whether the dialog is open.
- `onOpen?: () => void`: Callback function triggered when the dialog opens.

### Usage Examples

```tsx
// Basic usage
import { Dialog } from "./dialog";

function MyComponent() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open Dialog</button>
      <Dialog
        isOpen={isOpen}
        onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}
        dialogTitle="My Dialog"
        dialogId="example-dialog"
      >
        <div>Dialog content goes here</div>
      </Dialog>
    </>
  );
}
